  Structured descriptions of raw spatial data equip LLM with zero-shot execution of advanced spatial intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic management, etc.. Multi-field knowledge, context length, and reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban analysis.
